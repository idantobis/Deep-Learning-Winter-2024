        "   - **Description**: Develop a document scanning and analysis application specifically for the Museum of Jewish Soldiers in WWII. The project will focus on digitizing, recognizing, and categorizing documents and photos from the museum's archive. The system should use OCR to extract text, apply NLP to identify key entities (names, dates, locations), and categorize artifacts. This could include features to recognize specific military units, historical figures, or notable events. Extra functionality could involve cross-referencing names and events for a deeper historical analysis.\n",
